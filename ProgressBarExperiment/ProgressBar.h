/** Custom UIControl that presents an interactive progress bar.
 Modeled roughly after scrubbable video player control.
 When the user updates the position by scrubbing the bar,
 a UIControlEventValueChanged is sent. The permissable range
 of the position property (analogous to current position in video)
 is determined by the maxPosition property (analogous to how much
 video is available).
